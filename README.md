# Andon Project
  Nowadays, many software companies are facing  a problem that they did not openly talk about all of the bugs in the project and they rushed to release a new feature without completely checking out  the bug. Therefore, the source code might has a bug that can cause an effect to the company. So, the way to solve this problem is using something that can detect the fault in project and notify as Andon System.

  Andon system  is a system to detect and notify the fault in manufacturing in order to manage, maintain, and make sure that the product pass the standard quality. The centerpiece is a device incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem.
This project adapted Andon system concept and build a tool to help the company to detect and notify the fault in their software project.
